- [computor v1](https://github.com/jlutrera/computorv1): The program solves a polynomial third, second and lower degree equation. It shows the equation in its reduced form, the degree of the equation and it’s solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sens.
- [computor v2](https://github.com/jlutrera/computorv2): The project is an instruction interpreter that, like a shell, retrieves user inputs for advanced computations. It will present the form of a simple command interpreter, and will have to be able to answer some specifications.
- [ft_linear_regression](https://github.com/jlutrera/ft_linear_regression): The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning. For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
- [rt](https://github.com/jlutrera/rt): Your goal is to be able, with your program, to generate images according to the ray tracing technique.  Those computer generated images will each represent a scene, as seen from a specific angle and position of the camera / eye, defined by simple geometric objects and light
sources.
